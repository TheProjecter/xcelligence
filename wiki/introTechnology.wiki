Brief introduction to the technology

= Introduction =

xCELLigence System(R), also known as _RT-CES(R)_ System allows label-free, cell-based assays by measuring electronic impedances of cells. The system can be applied for both high-throughput screening and molecular and cellular biology research. Based on measured impedance, Cell Index (CI), a dimensionless parameter is derived and reported to provide quantitative information about the biological status of the cells, including cell number, viability, morphological changes.

# Background #
The xCELLigence System is developed and marketed by ACEA Biosciences Inc and Roche. It includes a series of different Real-Time Cell Analyzer (RTCA) instruments, which monitor the electrical impedance of cells in real time by micro-electrodes integrated into special-designed _E-plates_. The measurement, named as 'cell-index', provides quantitative information about the biological status of the cells, including cell number, viability and morphology.

# Overview #
This project develops the software package _**RTCA**_, with the programming language _GNU-R_. It provides open-source solution to read, transform, analyze and visualize data acquired from xCELLigence system. As an alternative to commercial software provided by the Roche company, _**RTCA**_ provides additional transformation algorithms and can be integrated into the _Bioconductor_ project and statistical environment R for downstream analysis.

The labeling-free system allows tracing time-dependent perturbation effects in a most natural culturing environment of cells, providing dynamic information and unique perspective into the cell-based assays.

XCELLIGENCE is a trademark of Roche.
RT-CES, E-PLATE and ACEA BIOSCIENCES are registered trademarks of ACEA Biosciences, Ind. in the US. Other brands or product names are trademarks of their respective holders.

The project has the name 'xcelligence' because there is another project named _rtca_. The R-project is still named as 'RTCA' but not XCELLIGENCE to avoid any conflict of trademark.
